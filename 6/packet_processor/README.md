Sensei's Hard Challenge: Network Packet Processor
Your task is to define an enum to represent various types of network packets and implement logic to process them using Rust's powerful pattern matching capabilities.

Core Requirements:

Define the Packet Enum:

Create an enum named Packet with the following variants. Each variant should carry relevant data:

Data { source_ip: String, destination_ip: String, payload: Vec<u8> }

Ack { packet_id: u32, receiver_ip: String }

Syn { sender_ip: String, sequence_number: u32 }

Fin { sender_ip: String }

Error(String) (a simple error message string)

Derive Debug for easy printing.

Implement a Method on the Packet Enum (process_packet):

Define a method process_packet(&self) for the Packet enum.

This method should take an immutable reference (&self) to a Packet instance.

Inside this method, use a match expression to perform different actions based on the packet variant:

For Data packets: Print a message indicating it's a Data packet, its source/destination IPs, and the size of its payload (e.g., "Received Data packet from X to Y with payload size Z bytes.").

For Ack packets: Print the packet ID and receiver IP.

For Syn packets: Print the sender IP and sequence number.

For Fin packets: Print the sender IP and a "Connection Close" message.

For Error packets: Print "Error Packet:" followed by the error message.

Crucial Test (Immutable Borrow): Inside the Data variant's arm of the match in process_packet, attempt to modify the payload (e.g., self.payload.push(0);). Comment out the line and explain the compiler error you get, linking it to the &self parameter and immutable borrows.

Implement another Method on the Packet Enum (get_sender_ip):

Define a method get_sender_ip(&self) -> Option<&String> for the Packet enum.

This method should return an Option<T> containing an immutable reference (&String) to the sender's IP address if the packet variant has one (e.g., Data, Syn, Fin). Otherwise, it should return None.

Use a match expression to extract the IP where available.

Demonstrate calling this method in main and then using match or if let to handle the Option result.

Implement a Free Function (process_all_packets):

Define a function process_all_packets(packets: Vec<Packet>). This function takes ownership of a vector of Packet instances.

Inside this function:

Iterate through the packets vector.

For each packet, call the process_packet method.

Use if let: Count how many Error packets are in the vector using if let (or for _ in packets.iter().filter_map(...)). Print the total count at the end.

Crucial Test (Ownership Transfer): After calling process_all_packets in main, try to use the original Vec<Packet> that you passed to it. Explain the compiler error related to ownership transfer.

Conceptual Questions (in your explanation):

Enum vs. Struct: When would you choose to use an enum over a struct? Provide a practical example different from the Packet scenario where an enum is clearly superior.

Option<T> and null: Explain the purpose of Option<T> in Rust. Why does Rust not have null? How does match help in handling Option<T> safely, preventing issues common in languages with null?

match Exhaustiveness: Describe the "exhaustiveness" of match expressions. Why is this a powerful and important feature for Rust's type safety?

if let Benefits: What are the benefits of if let compared to a full match expression? Provide a simple code example (not from this challenge) where if let is more appropriate and concise.

Instructions:

Create a new Rust project (cargo new packet_processor).

Implement the Packet enum and all required methods and functions.

In your main function, create a Vec<Packet> with a mix of different packet types to thoroughly test your logic.

For parts expected to fail compilation (due to ownership/borrowing errors), comment out the offending lines after observing the error. Include the exact compiler error message as a comment, along with your explanation.

Provide your complete main.rs file.

Provide a separate, clear explanation section answering all conceptual questions and detailing your observations for the challenge tests.

This challenge will push your understanding of Rust's powerful type system and control flow. Embrace the compiler errors as learning opportunities.

May your patterns always match, and your packets always flow!
